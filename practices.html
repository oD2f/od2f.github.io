	<p>The ODDF Practice Library is a curated set of the practices (work methods, management tools, organizational
		structures, templates, canvases, blueprints, playbooks, curricula, etc.) that organizations are using
		successfully as part of their transformation efforts. Overviews of each practice, as well as applicability,
		examples, relation to other practices, and pointers to related resources such as training will be included as
		well as ODDF-developed analysis, commentary, case studies, interviews, etc. The ODDF community will play an
		important part in expanding and evolving the Practice Library over time.</p>
