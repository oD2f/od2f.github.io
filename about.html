	<h2>What is ODDF?</h2>
	<p>ODDF is a non-profit organization specifically created to accelerate digital transformation for its members
		through sharing and collaboration across organizational boundaries. ODDF is the "Upstream" Community for open
		practices and code related to the Delivery aspects of Digital Transformation. Following the patterns of open
		source software communities, teams and individuals involved in their organizations' digital transformation will
		be able to accelerate their transformation by freely adopting and adapting open elements to their own
		organizational context. Further, they will be able to evolve and improve them, and (ideally) contribute them
		back to the ODDF for other participants' benefit. In addition to these open accelerators of digital
		transformation, ODDF will provide digital community and collaboration tools to provide a means for digital team
		to collaborate and co-create across organizational boundaries.</p>
	<!--	<h2>Where did this come from?</h2>-->
	<!--	<p>The idea for ODDF emerged from the founders' experience with the BC Developers' Exchange, which is an ongoing program within the government of the province of British Columbia, Canada.  The BC Developers' Exchange set out to build an ecosystem around public sector information technology that was more efficient and more collaborative while producing more innovative services for citizens and increased economic opportunity for the local technology industry.  Through its activities, the BC Developers' Exchange produced a number of bi-products in the form of open source software, knowledge, and work practices.  In keeping with its open philosophy, most of the bi-products produced by the BC Developers' Exchange have been made freely available under open source software licenses and the like. Some of these bi-products have been "forked" (copied) and applied in some form in other organizations.  Some of these bi-products will provide the seeds for the ODDF "Digital Upstream".</p>-->
