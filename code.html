	<p>The ODDF Code Library is a curated set of reusable open source code that organizations can incorporate or adapt
		for use in their own digital products, and co-evolve with the ODDF community. The contents of the Code Library
		will include small components for doing very specific things, up to entire business applications. Each code
		element in the Code Library will include supporting documentation to simplify reuse by any organization, as well
		as details about the individuals, teams, and organizations involved in its creation, as well as its status, and
		existing deployments or use cases.</p>
