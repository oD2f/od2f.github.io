	<p>The ODDF Community Platform is where interactions happen between community members, across organizational
		boundaries, as they support each other in their respective transformations, and come together to evolve and
		co-create ODDF open practices or code elements. The Community Platform will also serve as a type of live record
		of the evolution of the ODDF itself.</p>
